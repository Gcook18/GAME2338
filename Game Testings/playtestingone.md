**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_I felt the rules where easy to understand. However I think knowing where the Raven could see would have been helpful. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't affect game play?
> _Answer:_ I think the Raven making noise as much as it did was distracting especially because it puts emphasis on the music in the instructions below, outside of that I thought everything was as needed.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The puzzles get harder as it goes, but I never felt overwhelmed. So I think a puzzle game targeted audience would enjoy the game.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Honestly, I'd liked it to be longer. The aesthetic was pleasing, and the game was fun, and the sounds were rich; ten levels seems a bit short.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ I thought the game was fun to look at, and that was a reason I wanted to play the game. I think you could have really done any type of theme for the concept but the theme chosen was done very nicely.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ It was a bit confusing not knowing where the raven's sight ended, but over all, I enjoyed the game.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ Some issues i had where I'd go to click on a Diamond and end up moving a rock. That was just a matter of the camera angle and sorts. The other problem again, was knowing where the Raven was initially looking. I think I figured it out after some time playing but initially it makes the game frustrating.
