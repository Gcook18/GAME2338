**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The Rules where very easy to follow, especially with the beginning tutorial.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ I think everything was simple enough to be in the game, the effects made it visually impressive, and the there was nothing distracting to the game itself.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ I would say no. It seems like once you get stuck the game slows down dramatically and turns into a major guessing game.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ I suppose it seems silly to have God in such a modern setting, however I think the overall theme felt natural.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Yes, everything seemed to be very thought provoking but never take itself too seriously. 

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ In the beginning I did because I was doing well, however as it progressed it got more and more frutsterating.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I think the biggest issues is that if you rely on hints you don't feel you did as well, and the replay value is pretty low because once you know everything it's just memory at that point.
