## Summary
  Kingdom Hearts II is one of the best examples of what a sequel should be. Keeping true to it's fun and captivating story about friendship, loyalty, and the never ending fight against darkness, Kingdom Hearts II builds on all the amazing things fans loved in the first game.
  
  Kingdom Hearts II dominantly follows Sora, Donald and Goofy as they continue traveling across worlds to stop the heartless and save their friends. However this time around there is a new threat, Organization XIII and the nobodies. If you played the GameBoy Advanced game Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, you will have a slight understanding as to who Organization XIII is - a group of nobodies who are trying to open Kingdom Hearts so that they may become whole again. Through out Sora's journey you will come across many Disney and Final Fantasy characters that will help you, or try to stop you in your quest. 
  
  The opening of the game has players play as Roxas - Sora's nobody - as you and your friends do random tasks and jobs throughout the world of Twilight Town. This part of the game is meant to bridge the gap between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II with its use of flashbacks to both Kingdom Hearts, and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories. This at times feels drawn out and unnecessary, especially if you are a fan of the series who has already played the previous two games. 
  
  Once players free Sora, the game truly picks up and starts unraveling into a fun adventure with many twists and turns. Players will begin traveling from world to world leveling up and becoming more powerful, unlocking powerful spells and breathtaking combos. 


## Final Thoughts
Despite a slow start and times that feel otherwise empty Kingdom Hearts II is otherwise a perfect game, Kingdom Hearts II continues one of the best stories ever presented to the world of gaming,  offering to players great storytelling, fast paced combat, and fun yet challenging gameplay guaranteed to offer players hours of fun.
