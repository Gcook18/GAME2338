## Summary
  Kingdom Hearts II is one of the best examples of what a sequal should be. While keeping true to it's fun and captivating story about friendship, loyalty, and the never ending fight against darkness, Kingdom Hearts II builds on all the amazing things fans loved in the first game.
  Kingdom Hearts II dominantly follows Sora, Donald and Goofy as they continue traveling across worlds to stop the heartless and save their friends. However this time around there is a new threat, Orginization XIII and the nobodies. If you played the GameBoy Advanced game Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, you will have a slight understanding as to who Orginazion XIII is - a group of nobodies who are trying to open Kindom Hearts so that they may become whole again. Through out Sora's journey you will come across many Disney and Final Fantasy characters that will help you, or try to stop you in your quest. 
  However, the opening of the game has players play as Roxas - Sora's nobody as you and your friends do random tasks and jobs through out the world of Twilight Town. This part of the game is meant to bridge the gap between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II with it's use of flashbacks to both Kingdom Hearts, and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories. This at times feels drawn out and at times unnecissary especially if you are a fan of the series who has already played the previous two games. 


## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
