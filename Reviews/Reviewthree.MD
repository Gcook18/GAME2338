## Summary
  Civilization VI continues a beloved franchise of building up one of the greatest civilizations as players conquer lands through war, religion, and science. With many different characters with different bonuses and abilities, Civilization VI offers players a chance to play in their own style, from profit to warmonger. 
  
  Civilization as a franchise has been around for over 20 years and every game brings a fresh feel to a now familiar gameplay. Civilization is a turn based strategy game where players spend their turns controlling troops and builders, exploring a map, gathering resources, building grand wonders and building and researching technologies to grow their civilization. 
  
  The game itself has a very steep learning curve, but it is relatively easy to pick up and play. With a simple UI and tutorials to guide you through the game, the game can be played with relative ease from the start, however mastering the game, play styles, and in game politics requires players to explore the many ways of playing as well as learn about the AI players and their native play styles. This keeps games interesting as different pairings of AI can cause very different scenarios and alliances. 
  
  Compare to previous iterations, Civilization VI creates a smoother feel, with different checks and balances, new ways to build on the map, and more challenging ways to control the economy in both resources and gold. The game feels smoother, and more engaging. 
  
  The biggest drawback in the game remains how war focused it can become and drown out the other win conditions. It seems as long as you have the biggest military you can stay on top of the leaderboard, and as long as you take out the science leaders, you can easily take control of the map, and win the game. This makes going for things like faith, or culture very hard and almost repulsive. It'd been nice to see developers include a way for other play styles to really have a push or a balance against military victories. 


## Final Thoughts
With hours and hours of gameplay to be had, Civilization VI builds on everything that made Civilization V so great. The feeling that comes with victories is on of the most rewarding feelings a game has to offer. While more balancing in playstyles would have brought this game to perfection, the Civilization Franchise is still one of the best strategy games around.
