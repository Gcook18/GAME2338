  Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back follows Crash Bandicoot in yet another adventure, this time to help none other than Neo Cortex who claims to have repented since Crash Bandicoot. In Cortex Strikes Back players will go level through level collecting wompa fruit, breaking boxes, spinning and jumping through enemies, and collecting crystals in hopes to but an end to the darkness at bay. 
  
  Gameplay is fun, with different level designs and fun boss battles that offer a real chellenge Crash Bandicoot 2 keeps players on the edge of their seat while never feeling too difficult or too easy. I spent hours as a kid playing this game, and even today I have a real challenge with certain levels (CURSE YOU BOLDER!).
