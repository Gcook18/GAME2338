## Summary
Sonic 3 was on of the first games I remember playing, and boy did I play HOURS of it. Sonic 3 offered an easy to pick up game that after every level wanted me wanting to play more and more.
Sonic 3 let you play as Sonic & Tails; Tails; Sonic; or Knuckles as you went level to level freeing forest creatures from evil traps, collecting golden rings, and putting an end to Dr. Eggman (Dr.Robotnik)'s evil plans.
Each level has something new to offer, be it a burning forest filled with evil robots, underwater where you have to move fast to keep your breath up, or an Egyptian sand level full of random sand shooting from the ground at any moment, the level design of the game was truly amazing, and kept things fresh and challenging. 
One other thing that stands out amongst most games was the soundtrack. Sonic and Knuckles always sounded fun and exciting. The track always seemed fitting to the level and added greatly to the high-speed action that Sonic 3 provided.
## Final Thoughts
When told to write a review about a side-scrolling game, many games to mind: Mario, Odd World, Metroid, Mega-Man, as well as others, but one stood out. Sonic 3 was a game that will always be one of the greats [for me]. Few games defined my childhood as well as Sonic and Knuckles and just writing about it makes me want to go back and play it even more.
