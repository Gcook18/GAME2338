## Summary
Nathan Drake is back at it again in Naughty Dog's latest installment of the beloved franchise: Uncharted. In Uncharted 4 players follow Nathan Drake and his brother Sam as they try to find a long sought out treasure of the Pirate King Henry Avery. The brothers have long sought out the treasure, and now more than ever a pressing matter is at hand, as Sam's life depends on the finding of the treasure. Players will sneak, shoot, run, climb, and solve puzzles to advance their great adventure and get closer to the treasure.
Storytelling in Uncharted 4 is one of the best of any game, and possibly the best in the series, with the layers of character development as you explore the pasts of most characters including Drake, Sam, Sulley and even the love to hate antagonist Raith. The dialogue in the game is also amazing, with everything adding flavor and depth to the characters and their relationships with others. 
The game play is fast paced and never feels old, there is always a new approach to take in every situation, be it with high powered firearms, or sneaking around knocking out enemies to even the odds before the big gun fights to be had. With over the top movie moments Uncharted keeps players at the edge of their seats, as on the brink of unexpected danger. 

## Final Thoughts
As one of my personal all time favorite games, Uncharted 4 will always hold a deep place in my heart as being one of the most breathtaking games, from the writing, to the small attentions to details that I will never forget. Uncharted 4 is a great game for anyone, even if you haven't played the games before.

Side note: I was actually building my first game prototype when playing this game, and being able to look at this game from a perspective of a builder really helps you appreciate the game so much more. I think it's one of the coolest things about being in the gaming industry.
