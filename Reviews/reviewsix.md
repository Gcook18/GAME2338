## Summary
Doodle God is a puzzle game where players must combine elements to create things. With over 115 combinations, the game can get very thought provoking and challenging. The game is offered in mobile, flash player, as well as windows, playstation, and many other platforms.

## Final Thoughts
While the game will provide hours of fun and great puzzle ideas, it also provides hours of frustration, and with little help, even with hints, the game can feel almost impassable and make you run to the internet for tutorials which really takes away from the quality from the game.
