## Summary
Cuphead is a very simplistic game that is not for the feint of heart. Weather playing with friends, or battling for your soul back solo,Cuphead provides players with an adventure that is sure to include many deaths along the way. First the good; Cuphead is a fast-paced fun game that can be enjoyed solo or with the help of player 2. Cuphead allows players to play couch co-op or online, as you battle boss after boss, level after level with your friends right at home, or afar. Throughout the story you can begin to mold Cuphead [or Mugman] into your own unique play style through upgrades and different ammo types. Each level is packed from start to finish with non-stop action that will require a great deal of skill and reflexes to survive the brutal challenge laid before players. This game is not easy, nor does it try to be. With players comparing the game's difficulty to that of games like Dark Soul and Ninja Gaiden. 

Cuphead falls short in very interesting ways. Where the game offers a great challenge that is very rewarding when accomplished, getting there at times feels impossible and frusterating. Eventually instead of "Try Again" players could easily find themselves in "I Quite". A player then could try to bring a friend, but unless that friend is equally skilled in the game, or has spent as much time as you have trying over and over again, it can at times feel like you are now assigned to not only beating the level, but babysitting someone who can't pull their own weight. Another issue is while there are upgrades, and different ammo types, you can quickly unlock all of them and it limits just how much you can craft your gameplay experiance. The biggest set back I see in Cuphead is it's lack of easier difficulty. This game has one mode and if you can't beat the level, you truly are stuck. This is not a game for people who are bad at video games and I feel thatlimits the audiance greatly. Anything that stops people from playing your game in my opinion is a major red flag to a game's greatness.


## Final Thoughts
Some of the biggest feelings of accomplishment come to you when you see the credits roll in Cuphead but getting there is going to take blood, sweat, tears, and a lot of finger guns. This 50's style game is one of the best Indie games to ever hit the market, but it's downfall can be why some consider it great.
