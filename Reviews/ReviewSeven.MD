### Rating
8.5/10
While the game is an amazing tool for learning the guitar, not a lot of love was given to learning Bass or in some ways Lead guitar.

## Summary
Rocksmith is one of the most amazing concepts in gaming history. The ability to teach someone a musical instrument is no small feat, and the fact a video game was able to accomplish such a task is revolutionary to the the industry. As far as gameplay, rocksmith plays like it's guitar playing predecessors, notes come down the screen and once they hit the string you strum. Chords display the name of the chord when played, but single strings used in lead guitar and bass are left with no note or fret numbers. The mini games help train actual guitar skills while the songs help the player implement those skills they fine tune. With new songs every month through DLC the wide variety of songs are great for anyone looking from anything from country and folk, to rock and metal. The Game has something for any guitar enthusiast. 


## Final Thoughts
While the game is a great teacher, it falls short in things like lead guitar and bass as far as playing songs go. And while this may seem like a small deficit, however it takes away from at least half the audience playing. However, the tutorials, minigames, and wide variety of songs offers endless fun and learning to be had for anyone willing to dedicate their time to the amazing experience Ubisoft made.
